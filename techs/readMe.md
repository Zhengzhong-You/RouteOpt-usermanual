# Techniques Overview

In RouteOpt, we employ a variety of sophisticated techniques to tackle complex optimization problems effectively. Here's
a summary of the key techniques utilized:

1. [Enumeration Tree Writing](/branching/readMe.md)
    - This technique involves solving extremely difficult instances by meticulously writing out enumeration trees. It's
      a systematic approach where we explore all possible solutions to find the optimal one. This method is particularly
      useful in scenarios where precision and thoroughness are paramount.

2. **Branching Strategies**:
    - Our branching strategies are crucial in navigating the solution space efficiently. By carefully choosing which
      branches of the solution tree to explore, we can significantly reduce the computational load and quickly converge
      on the most promising solutions.

3. **Heuristic Generation Scheme (HGS)**:
    - For solving complex Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP), we integrate a heuristic method known as HGS. You
      can find more information about this approach on our GitHub
      repository: [HGS-CVRP](https://github.com/vidalt/HGS-CVRP). This method is renowned for its efficiency and
      effectiveness in generating high-quality solutions in a reasonable time frame.

4. **Change Dual** (Coming Soon):
    - We're excited about the upcoming introduction of the 'Change Dual' technique. While details are under wraps, this
      method promises to bring a fresh perspective to how we handle dual variables in optimization problems. Stay tuned
      for more updates on this innovative approach.

5. **DELUXING_APPLIED** (Coming Soon):
    - Another anticipated feature is 'DELUXING_APPLIED'. This technique is in development and aims to introduce advanced
      mechanisms to further refine the solution process. We believe it will significantly enhance the efficiency and
      effectiveness of our optimization strategies.

Each of these techniques plays a vital role in making RouteOpt a powerful tool for solving complex optimization
problems. We're constantly working on improving these techniques and introducing new ones to stay at the forefront of
optimization technology.

As RouteOpt continues to evolve, we invite our users to stay updated with the latest developments and look forward to
their valuable feedback and contributions.
