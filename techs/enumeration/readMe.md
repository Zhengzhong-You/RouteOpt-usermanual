# Enumeration Tree Writing

The Enumeration Tree Writing in RouteOpt is a two-stage approach designed for solving extremely challenging instances
by parallelizing the solution process. Here's an overview of how it works:

### 1. Writing Out Enumeration Trees

- **Activation**:
  To activate the enumeration tree writing process, uncomment the following line in ```techniqueControl.hpp```:
  ```cpp
  //#define WRITE_ENUMERATION_TREES
  ```

- **Differences from Default Solver**:
    1. **Node Selection Rule**: Shifts to a depth-first strategy, primarily to save memory.
    2. **Node Inspection Post-Enumeration**: Even after successful enumeration of a node, we continue inspecting it
       until a 'tail off' in cutting occurs. At this point, the node is written out.

- **Output Folders**:
  The process results in the creation of two folders:
    - `EnuTree` (`#define TREE_FOLDER std::string("EnuTree")`): Stores enumeration tree files, each recording:
        - Node information (refer to the 'main information' part in the output section).
        - Mathematical form of cuts (not the specific coefficients).
        - Index of columns in `EnuColPool` (all tree files share a single column pool, to conserve memory).

    - `EnuColPool` (`#define COL_POOL_FOLDER std::string("EnuColPool")`): Stores the column pool information in a single
      file, which includes the sequence information of all routes (columns).

### 2. Reading Enumeration Trees

- **Activation**:
  To enable the reading of specific enumeration trees, uncomment this line:
  ```cpp
  //#define READ_ENUMERATION_TREES
  ```
  Note: `READ_ENUMERATION_TREES` and `WRITE_ENUMERATION_TREES` cannot be activated simultaneously.

- **Functionality**:
  This stage involves reading a specific enumeration tree and then solving it. As the labeling process is not required,
  the memory typically allocated for labeling isnâ€™t used. Consequently, the memory requirement for this job should be
  significantly lower than a regular job.
